## Skills & Interests
* Understanding technical needs in infrastructure and how those needs can be met by building or acquiring tooling
* Impactful communication via professional documentation, processes and standards
* Working in minimal-downtime environments - activities such as rolling deployments, DNS switchover, planned maintenance windows, and disaster recovery
* Experience with cloud-centric applications in AWS that were deployed to EKS clusters, used IAM roles for authentication, S3 buckets and EBS volumes for persistence
* Familiarity with other cloud providers such as Azure and Openstack

### **Rate Limiting in Envoy:** December 2021
* Configured Envoy to rate-limit requests to our company’s main, multi-tenant application
* Envoy’s off-the-shelf rate-limiting implementation in Golang lacked support for configuring unique rate limits per OIDC group, so we forked the codebase and I added the feature
